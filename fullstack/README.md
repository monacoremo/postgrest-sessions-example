# PostgREST full stack example

This more advanced example that extends the [basic PostgREST session-based
authentication example](../README.md) to a secure full stack application with a
web frontend.

As we have a lot more dependencies in this version, we will use the full power
of Nix. It will no longer be optional, as it was in the basic example.
